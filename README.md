 // Brief Description of what you did: create a functional website based on this prototype: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3e3b745f-aa5a-460e-5fd7-8cc90c248d21-480a/screen/2bce9ed2-c1ed-4a71-ae23-37c1e019d677/ using bootsrap

// Comments: Over all the site looks pretty close to the mockup. I did notice some things that could be adjusted. I feel the links in the nav bar should change to a lighter color than black, maybe a light grey. The buttons on the room cards don't line up, maybe use a align-self: end on them to get them to sit the same.
The valet image is a little bit bigger then the others, should just need its own sizing. The button in the reserve section is a little bit taller then the input fields. Okay now on to tablet and mobile. When your navbar hamburger is toggled I noticed that the image is still inbetween the links, using the bootstrap break points should allow you to hide it when it hits a certain screen size. In your Awards section I would have had the large image go hidden so you don't have the spacing issues. The room cards seem to get stretched out before them transform to a differnt style, maybe have them change on a larger screen size. There is a little wonkyness with the images in the amenities section, either adjusting the sizes of the images or having them go hidden should fix that. The images in the packages section seem out of place as the screen size gets smaller, maybe hiding them would make it not look as cluttered.
